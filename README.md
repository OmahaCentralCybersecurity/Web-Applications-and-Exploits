# Web-Applications-and-Exploits

An exercise showing basic web vulnerabilities.

### Set Up a Cloud-Based Server:  
- [Paiza.cloud](https://paiza.cloud/)  
- Code you wrote for your website Repl.it.  
- This is a helpful larger tutorial:  https://www.taniarascia.com/create-a-simple-database-app-connecting-to-mysql-with-php/ 

On Paiza Cloud we will create a new server that will allow us to communicate from the front-end (html) of our application to the back end (database).  We will be sending the server GET and POST requests based on whether we need to get data from our database or we need to add/update/delete data from it. 

### PHP 
PHP is one of the most common languages used for web development.  It enables us to embed PHP code in a simple HTML file.  

Together with a server and database, we can create a fully functional web application that can run locally on our computer.  Piaza.cloud is web-based development environment that provides us with a server, database (and admin), and php so that we can easily create a web application without worrying about all of the configurations that come with deploying our own web apps.  Navigate to  https://engineering.paiza.io/entry/paizacloud_php which is a quick tutorial of how to set up a web applicaiton on paiza.cloud.  We will eventually do our own. 

PHP can be embedded alongside HTML and allows us to create web pages that can change based upon user input/iteraction.  Any PHP code can embedded with HTML with `<?php ?>` and then any PHP code can be placed inside which includes any text/data that we want to be displayed.  We can also use the shortcut of `<?= ?>`

For example:  

```php
<h1> Hello </h1>
<?=
    'Hello' + 'PHP';
?>
```
To extend this idea, imagine that we have all of the logic to query and receive data from our SQL database and then create logic to display it within our HTML.  

### SQL  

SQL or Structure Query Language is the way that we can communicate with our database.  It allows us to retrieve, add, update, and delete data from our database.  We will stick with the main operations of 'INSERT', 'SELECT', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE', 'CREATE' and 'DROP'.  By convention, any SQL specific command is written in all caps.   

For example:
