# Web-Applications-and-Exploits

An exercise showing basic web vulnerabilities.

### Set Up a Cloud-Based Server:  
- [Paiza.cloud](https://paiza.cloud/)  
- Code you wrote for your website Repl.it.  
- This is a helpful larger tutorial:  https://www.taniarascia.com/create-a-simple-database-app-connecting-to-mysql-with-php/ 

On Paiza Cloud we will create a new server that will allow us to communicate from the front-end (html) of our application to the back end (database).  We will be sending the server GET and POST requests based on whether we need to get data from our database or we need to add/update/delete data from it. 

### PHP 
PHP is one of the most common languages used for web development.  It enables us to embed PHP code in a simple HTML file.  

Together with a server and database, we can create a fully functional web application that can run locally on our computer.  Piaza.cloud is web-based development environment that provides us with a server, database (and admin), and php so that we can easily create a web application without worrying about all of the configurations that come with deploying our own web apps.  Navigate to  https://engineering.paiza.io/entry/paizacloud_php which is a quick tutorial of how to set up a web applicaiton on paiza.cloud.  We will eventually do our own. 

PHP can be embedded alongside HTML and allows us to create web pages that can change based upon user input/iteraction.  Any PHP code can embedded with HTML with `<?php ?>` and then any PHP code can be placed inside which includes any text/data that we want to be displayed.  We can also use the shortcut of `<?= ?>`

For example:  

```php
<h1> Hello </h1>
<?=
    'Hello' + 'PHP';
?>
```
To extend this idea, imagine that we have all of the logic to communicate with our SQL database and then create logic to display it within our HTML.  

### SQL  

SQL or Structure Query Language is the way that we can communicate with our database.  It allows us to retrieve, add, update, and delete data from our database.  We will stick with the main operations of 'INSERT', 'SELECT', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE', 'CREATE' and 'DROP'.  By convention, any SQL specific command is written in all caps.   

The following example would create a new table called `users` that includes information that might be helpful for us to store about a user.  
```sql

CREATE TABLE users(
userId INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
firstName VARCHAR(128),
lastName VARCHAR(128),
email VARCHAR(128),
message VARCHAR(255),
PRIMARY KEY (userId)); 
```
‚úèÔ∏è Note that we are setting the primary key to be the userId.  In many relationnal databases, it is common to ensure that data is not repeated and that queries will always return the same value for a given query.  Imagine we had multiple users and we were trying to query a user by their firstName. If we had multiple users with `firstName = 'Bill'`, then trying to query a specific Bill would be difficult without more information.  For this reason, we will provide a primary key that guarantees each piece of data can be uniquely identified in our table's data.  Many times it is easiest to use an auto-incrementing id number at the primary key because it is easy to ensure those numbers won't be repeated.  

There are so many resources to learn SQL.  Codecademy and W3Schools would have sufficient documentation for you to extend your learning of SQL.  

We could then add a new user to our users table by writing the query: 
```sql
INSERT INTO users (firstName, lastName, email, message) VALUES ('Mr.', 'Holmquist', 'collin.holmquist@ops.org', 'Hello there!'); 
```
üëÄ Notice that we don't include the userId because the database will automatically do that for us.  

We can then get information from our table by doing the following query: 
```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```
This would return:  `userId: 1, firstName: 'Mr.', lastName: 'Holmquist, email: 'collin.holmquist@ops.org', message: 'Hello there!'`
The * is a wildcard and tells SQL to return every piece of data from our table's columns.  Additionally, if there are multiple rows of users in our table, then it will return all of them.  

In Paiza Cloud, there is a PHPAdmin program that allows us to interact with our database through a GUI instead of solely through our application or the terminal.
