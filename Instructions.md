# Instructions:

For our web application we will be structuring it like such:  

- index.html 
- contact.html
- contact.php
- viewData.html
- viewData.php
- resume.html

Rememeber that we can place both html and php within the same file.  Additionally, we can link our CSS file directly to our php file like we normally would in the html between the head tags.  

Notice that contact and user contain php and html files.  That is because contact will include a form and users will include the ability to look at all of our users.  Those require us to have communication with our database.  Index.html and Resume.html will just be served up as static files by our sever when we request them.
