# Instructions:

For our web application we will be structuring it like such:  

- index.html 
- contact.html
- contact.php
- viewData.html
- viewData.php
- resume.html

You should be able to navigate between index, contact, and resume.  

Rememeber that we can place both html and php within the same file.  Additionally, we can link our CSS file directly to our php file like we normally would in the html between the head tags.  

Notice that contact contains php and html files.  That is because contact will include a form which will require us to have communication with our database.  Index.html and Resume.html will just be served up as static files by our sever when we request them.  

## Web Application Architecture
Our web application will be using HTML, CSS, PHP, an Apache Server and then MySQL for the database.  While we won't have to do the work to configure everything to work together, we will need to understand how everything works.  That will adequately prepare us when we begin to discuss web exploits.  

Here is a diagram of a high-level view of how a web application works:

In our case, we are using PHP as our scripting language that uses our web server to communicate with our MySQL database.  Additionally, our webserver communicates with our file system to display html/css.
